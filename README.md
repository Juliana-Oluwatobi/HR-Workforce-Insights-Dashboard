# HR-Workforce-Insights-Dashboard
## Insight into staff strength and attrition rate 
## Project Overview
#### To design and implement a dynamic HR analytics dashboard that provides real-time visibility into workforce composition and trends, specifically focusing on total headcount, employee attraction rate, and age band distribution. This dashboard will help management make quality in hiring, developement and staff retention.
## Technology Stack:
* Data Source: HRIS system (Workday)
* ETL Tool: (Power Query)
* Dashboard Tool: Microsoft Excel / Power BI 
## Dashboard Features:
* Interactive filters (by department, location, job level, and time period).
* Visualizations including bar charts, pie charts, and donut charts.
* Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis.
* Export and share options for reporting.

### EDA
General Employee Profile
1. What is the total number of employees in the dataset?
2. How is the workforce distributed by department or business unit?
3. What is the gender and diversity distribution across the organization?
4. What is the distribution of employees by job level or role?
5. What is the average age of employees? What does the age distribution look like?
Attraction & Retention
6. How many new hires have joined in the past 12 months?
7. What is the monthly or quarterly attraction rate?
8. What is the retention rate by department or job level?
9. Which departments have the highest turnover?
10. What is the average tenure of employees by department, role, or age group?
 
 ### Key Findings
* Strong Workforce Age Band: 25–34 Years
The largest segment of the workforce falls within the 25–34 age group.
Indicates a relatively young and potentially early-career employee base.
Suggests opportunities for career development and leadership grooming.
* Highest Attraction Rate: Research Department
The Research department leads in new hires, contributing the most to organizational growth.
Suggests strong talent acquisition performance in this area, possibly due to expansion, innovation initiatives, or competitive roles.

### Recommendation

1. Invest in Talent Development for the 25–34 Age Group
2. Leverage Success in the Research Department
3. Investigate Inactive Employee Segment
4. Balance Workforce Age Distribution
5. Monitor Workforce Trends Monthly

### Limitation
1. Data accuracy and completeness 
The dashbaord relies on Data from HR systems, which contains outdated or incomplete records(e.g inactive employee not updated, missing demographic details)

2. Attraction Rate Not Standardized Across Departments
High attraction in certain departments (e.g., Research) may be due to expansion or project-based hiring, which may not reflect long-term workforce trends.
